Title: [Phase2_Activity1_1] Add Basic Node.js Project
Description:
In this PR, I have added a basic Node.js project to the Phase2_Activity1_1 branch. The project includes the following changes:

    Created a new file called server.js to serve as the entry point of the application.
    Create math.js file to do simple equations or math functions
    Implemented a simple "Hello, World!" functionality to test the setup.
    Added a package.json file to manage project dependencies.
    Installed the necessary Node.js packages using npm install.
    Updated the README.md file with instructions on how to run the project.
